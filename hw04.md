# Data Reshaping Prompts (and relationship to aggregation)

## Activity \#1

**Make your own cheatsheet similar to Tyler Rinker’s minimal guide to
tidyr**

# Join Prompts (join, merge, look up)

## Activity \#1

  - Problem: You have two data sources and you need info from both in
    one new data object.

  - Solution: Perform a join, which borrows terminology from the
    database world, specifically SQL.

  - Create a second data frame, complementary to Gapminder. Join this
    with (part of) Gapminder using a dplyr join function and make some
    observations about the process and result. Explore the different
    types of joins. Examples of a second data frame you could build:

  - One row per country, a country variable and one or more variables
    with extra info, such as language spoken, NATO membership, national
    animal, or capitol city.

  - One row per continent, a continent variable and one or more
    variables with extra info, such as northern versus southern
    hemisphere.
